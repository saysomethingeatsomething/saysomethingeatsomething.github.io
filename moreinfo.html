	  <h1><a href="index.html">Homework for US,</a></h1>
	  <h2>a listening project.</h2>
	  <p>We’ve been sitting in the back of class all semester, chatting with our friends. Now we have some make-up work to do: pop our bubbles and listen to people outside our own echo-chambers.</p>
	</header>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Get ready.</h2>

			<p>Wear a t-shirt or display a sign to initiate and introduce yourself to passerby. We have a t-shirt that you can buy (we’re selling it at cost), and PDFs that you can print.</p>
			<p>How you choose to do this is up to you, but it should be legible at a distance, approachable, and explain our goal clearly.</p>

			<h2>Be prepared.</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>Conversations could veer into uncomfortable territory.</li>
				<li>Expect to hear things that you don't personally agree with.</li>
				<li>Listen, don't try to argue or escalate. Our goal is to understand feelings, not change them.</li>
				<li>Ask thoughtful followup questions. Let people say as much as they want.</li>
				<li>Protect yourself. Work in pairs, in a public place.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Share what you've heard.</h2>

			<p>Have a good conversation? Let the world know! <a href="http://ctt.ec/Mt8c3">Tweet</a> or post on Instagram with <strong>#hw4us</strong>, but be sure not to violate the privacy of anyone you've met.</p>
		
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Notes.</h2>

			<p>We recognize that not everyone has the ability to travel for the holidays. We believe that those of us that are traveling have a responsibility to use this economic privilege to help understand, share, and bridge divides. Similarly, not everyone has the privilege to talk to strangers without fear of harassment.</p>

			<p>If you are unable to offer "food for your thoughts" this winter, consider asking others who can. Share your own hopes, or the hopes of your local community, with <strong>#hw4us</strong>.</p>

			<h2>Ready? Let's do it.</h2>

			<p>Commit to finish your homework, and assign it to a friend too.</p>
