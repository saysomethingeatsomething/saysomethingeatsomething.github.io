	  <h1><a href="index.html">Homework for US</a></h1>
	  <h2>a listening project.</h2>
	  <p>That last exam was rough. Real talk, America: if we don’t want to fail, we have to do some serious make-up work.</p>
	</header>

	<main>
		<div class="section">
			<h2>Get ready.</h2>

			<p>Display a sign or wear a shirt to welcome and introduce yourself to passerby. We posters that you can print, a design in vector format for making your own shirt, or a t-shirt that you can buy through Teespring, sold at cost. <em>Teespring shirts will <strong>not</strong> arrive before Thanksgiving.</em></p>

			<p>How you choose to do this is up to you, but it should be legible at a distance, approachable, and explain our goal clearly.</p>

			<h2>Be prepared.</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>Work in pairs, in a public place.</li>
				<li>Conversations could veer into uncomfortable territory.</li>
				<li>Expect to hear things that you don't personally agree with.</li>
				<li>Listen, don't try to argue or escalate. Yur goal is to understand feelings, not change them.</li>
				<li>Ask thoughtful followup questions. Let people say as much as they want.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Share what you've heard.</h2>

			<p>Have a good conversation? Let the world know! <a href="http://ctt.ec/Mt8c3">Tweet</a> or post on Instagram with <strong>#AmericaListens</strong>, but be sure not to violate the privacy of anyone you've met. Ask permission before posting an image of someone or their specific story.</p>

		<div class="section">
			<h2>Notes.</h2>

			<p>We recognize that not everyone has the ability to travel for the holidays. We believe that those of us who are traveling have a responsibility to use this economic privilege to help understand, share, and bridge divides. Similarly, we acknowledge that not everyone has the privilege to talk to strangers without fear of harassment.</p>

			<p>If you are unable to offer "food for your thoughts" this winter, consider asking others who can to do so. Share your own hopes, or the hopes of your local community, with <strong>#AmericaListens</strong>.</p>

			<h2>Ready? Let's do it.</h2>

			<p>Commit to finish your homework, and assign it to a friend too.</p>
